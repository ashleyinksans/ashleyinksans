<p>𖥔 [ * My pronouns are <b>They/Vial/Ink</b> ]</p>
<p>𖥔 I'm a <b>digital art SFW artist!</b> I'm an asian. I love interacting with a lot of people, everyone is welcome as long as they obtain a friendship and become supportive!</p>
<p>𖥔<b>I don't share personal information if we just met.</b> I'm also <b>uncomfortable with feminine nicknames</b> such as babygirl, mamacita, and so on unless you're an exception</p>
<p>𖥔 I'm random on ponytown when I feel like it, you can see me everywhere in the sonic spot! I'll get along with you and you know what it looks like.</p>
