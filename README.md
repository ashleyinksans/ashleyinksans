<p>ð–¥” My pronouns are <b>They/Vial/Ink</b></p>
<p>ð–¥” I'm a <b>digital art SFW artist!</b> I'm a white asian. I love interacting with a lot of people, [[everyone]] is welcome as long as you obtain a cool friendship and community!</p>
<p>ð–¥” I'm <b>uncomfortable with sudden feminine nicknames</b> such as babygirl, mamacita, and so on unless you're irl/online friends with me!</p>
<p>ð–¥” I'm random on ponytown when I feel like it, you can see me everywhere in the sonic spot! I wasn't really into any jokes irl. I'll get along with you and you know what it looks like!</p>
